# 🧙‍♂️ J.A.R.V.I.S.

> Just A Rather Veritable Intelligent System

:rocket: Blazing fast companion for 🧑‍💻 SW development.

🧙‍♂️ J.A.R.V.I.S. is a FREE and Open Source desktop app that runs on Mac, Windows and Linux that contains most of the tools needed for Software Development.

It is built with Rust ([Tauri](https://tauri.app/)) and TypeScript ([React](https://reactjs.org/)).

\*This is a pet project where I intent to learn Rust. Any language suggestions or corrections are more than welcome.
